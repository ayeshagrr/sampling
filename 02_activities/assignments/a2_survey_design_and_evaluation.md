# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.  In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.  Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.  Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios

1.  You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.  You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.  You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1.  Sample type
2.  Sample size
3.  Target population
4.  Sampling frame
5.  Survey mode(s)
6.  Timeline
7.  Response rate
8.  Weights
9.  Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design:

The number of your chosen topic: `#3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:

```         
The survey examines how age and life stage shape music taste, with a focus on perceptions of popular music. By following the same cohort of University of Toronto students from first to fourth year and also comparing students of different ages within each stage, the study assesses both (a) cross-sectional age differences in popular music preferences and evaluations and (b) longitudinal changes in individuals’ tastes over time.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

```         
Target population: Undergraduate students enrolled at the University of Toronto St. George (UTSG) and University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC), with interest in tracking a cohort from first year through fourth year.

Sampling frame: Institutional lists of all first-year undergraduate students at UTSG and UTSC in the cohort’s entry year.

Sampling units: Individual students (sampled from UTSG and UTSC).

Observational units: Individual students’ survey responses at each stage (i.e., repeated observations per student across years).
```

    - less than 30m
    - 30-60m
    - 1-2h

5. On average, how many days a week do you spend listening to current popular music (e.g., mainstream hits on the radio, most viral songs etc.)
    - Never
    - 1-3 days
    - 4-6 days
    - Every Day
6. Favourite genre of music?
    - Pop

7. Overall, how would you describe your perception of today’s popular music? (1 = Very negative, 5 = Very positive)
    - 1 – Very negative
    - 2 – Somewhat negative
    - 3 – Neutral
    - 4 – Somewhat positive
    - 5 – Very positive
8. Compared to ONE YEAR AGO, how has your interest in current popular music changed?
    - Much less interested
    - Slightly less interested
    - No change
    - Slightly more interested
    - Much more interested
9. To what extent do you feel that your music taste aligns with that of others in your age range? (1 = Not at all, 5 = Very much)
   - 1 – Not at all
   - 2 – Slightly
   - 3 – Moderately
   - 4 – Mostly
   - 5 – Very much

10. What are the main reasons your music preferences have stayed the same or changed over the past year? [OPEN ENDED]
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```         
Sample type: Cross-sectional, probability sample using a stratified design (stratification at the province/census metropolitan area level). Information is collected from one randomly selected household member aged 15 or older, and proxy responses are not permitted.

Sample size: Used a field sample of approximatively 50,000 units and invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent to about 40,000 selected households across Canada. A completion of 24,000 questionnaires was expected and final overall response rate was 41.9%.

Target population: All persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. 

Sampling frame: A frame combining landline and cellular telephone numbers from Census and administrative sources plus Statistics Canada’s dwelling frame; records are telephone-number groups linked to an address when possible.

Survey mode(s): Electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing).

Timeline: 2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28

Response rate: 41.9%.

Weights: Basic person weight for population estimates (WGHT_PER) and bootstrap weights  provided for design-based variance estimation.

Data processing: Data processed using Social Survey Processing Environment (SSPE). Micro and macro level checks including family, consistency, and flow edits.

Cleaning, imputation, etc: Item/partial nonresponse handled mainly using donor (nearest-neighbour) imputation via a score function; mean imputation used when donor imputation wasn’t possible. Imputation carried out in nine steps, covering income, formal volunteering, informal volunteering, donation file variables, and solicitation method variables.

Sources of error:

Sampling error: because estimates come from a sample; variance estimated using the bootstrap method with bootstrap weights.

Non-sampling error: includes coverage error, nonresponse, response error, and processing error.

Coverage error source explicitly mentioned: exclusion of households without telephones / frame coverage gaps.

Limitations, known biases, etc:

Sampling error: survey is based on a sample rather than a full census, estimates are subject to random variation and may differ from the true population values.

Low response rate (41.9%): response rate below 50% increases the risk that respondents may differ systematically from non-respondents, potentially affecting representativeness.

Non-response bias: Non-response occurred at both the household and individual levels. Although survey weights were adjusted using administrative data, residual bias may remain if non-respondents differ in unmeasured ways.

Coverage error (telephone-based frame): Households without telephones or not covered by the telephone frame were excluded from the surveyed population, which may bias results if these households differ from those included.

Undercoverage and overcoverage: Despite improvements over past random digit dialing methods, the survey frame may still include some overcoverage or undercoverage relative to the target population.

Response error: Errors may arise from inaccurate or biased responses provided by participants (e.g., misunderstanding questions or recall issues).

Processing error: Errors may occur during data processing, coding, editing, or weighting, despite quality control procedures.
